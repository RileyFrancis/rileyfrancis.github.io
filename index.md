# 👋 Hi, I'm **Riley Francis**

🎓 **Dual-Degree Student** — Computer Science & Pure Mathematics  
📍 *University of Connecticut* · *Honors Scholar* · *STEM Merit Scholar*  
✈️ *Study Abroad, University of Edinburgh (Spring 2025)*

### 💡 About Me
I’m a student passionate about **graph theory**, **machine learning**, and **AI interpretability**.  
My research explores how we can use **graph neural networks** to better understand complex systems —  
from **fMRI brain networks** in neuroscience to **autonomous systems** in computer vision.

When I’m not coding or studying math proofs, I enjoy building projects like my  
*D&D inventory manager web app*, working with **Unity** and **Rust**, and participating in  
**Science Olympiad at UConn**, which I helped found and now manage as Treasurer.
